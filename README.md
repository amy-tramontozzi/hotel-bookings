This project was undertaken as the final project for the Data Engineering course of the MS Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago. The goal is to create and store a dataset that enables prediction of hotel booking cancellations for a hotel in Lisbon based on weather, customer, and event data. Weather data is scraped using OpenWeather's public API in Juyter Notebook. Datasets are cleaned in R and dimensionally modeled in SQL. Visualizations are created in Tableau.
